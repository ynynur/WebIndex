## WebIndex
The main purpose of the web indexing project is to develop a web-based application that indexes and ranks multiple other web pages in terms of similarity according to the web page content at a given URL.
With the project, it is aimed to gain knowledge about web indexing methods and develop web-based application writing skills. This project was developed on IntelliJIDEA.

When we look at search engines, there is a search field and after a keyword is entered in this field, the websites with the closest content are listed according to the semantic relationship of this keyword with the existing content.
In the project, it is aimed to enter a URL instead of a keyword and to perform some actions on the referenced URL.
